### End Notes ðŸ“‘

In this project I were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given me a good experience of react and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave me a lot of confidence. Minimal features are added and functionality of the website is achieved so far.

### Limitations:

All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
(Recomended Resolution: 1920 x 1080 )
